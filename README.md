# Python-laboratory

A short collection of not-so-complex Python stuff for Cryptography, Spring 2021.
_Note: all the user input stuff can easily be removed, it may be annoying for someone - not for me though, I made it for funsies!_

Spring 2022: I found most files in my drive, thought I had lost them for good! they have been uploaded.
